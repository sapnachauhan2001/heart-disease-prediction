## Overall Learning 

> During this course, I learned the fundamentals of Data Science. Working with different machine learning models helped me understand the strengths and limitations of various algorithms. Ensemble methods proved to be more robust compared to simpler models. This project also improved my problem-solving skills, debugging ability, and understanding of end-to-end machine learning pipelines. I gained hands-on experience with Python and it's libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn etc.
> In this internship my project is Heart disease prediction. Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death globally, making early detection and prevention extremely important. This project focuses on building a machine learning–based system to predict the risk of heart disease using patient demographic, clinical, lifestyle, and medical history data. The objective of the project is to assist healthcare professionals by providing early risk assessment and supporting preventive decision-making.

<h3 id="project1">Project 1: Heart Disease Prediction </h3>
<p>
  Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, making early prediction and prevention extremely important. This project focuses on building a heart disease prediction system using machine learning techniques to analyze healthcare data and identify individuals at risk. The project involved designing and developing a basic functional module using the core concepts taught in the course. It focused on understanding project requirements, writing structured and efficient code, and implementing key features such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training. The system demonstrates how fundamental data science and machine learning concepts can be applied to solve real-world healthcare problems.

## **Learnings from LST and SST**

<!-- add your experiences over here -->
>The Life Skill Training (LST) sessions helped me enhance my core personal skills such as self-awareness, confidence, time management, and decision-making. These sessions improved my ability to handle challenges calmly, set clear goals, and stay motivated, which directly supported my learning and productivity during the internship.
The Soft Skill Training (SST) sessions strengthened my communication, teamwork, presentation, and professional etiquette skills. They helped me express my ideas more effectively, collaborate better with others, and adapt to a professional work environment, making me more confident and industry-ready.
